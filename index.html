    <h2 class="Maroon">Anime/Manga</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Anime is my favourite form of entertainment; This is a Japanese animation
      with several genres which can both come in series and movies. My favourite
      anime is Jujutsu Kaisen because it has a lot of plot twists and action, as
      well as the animation, it's really good and I recommend watching it.
